# "Lights Out"
## Written in May of 2020 after finding and buying the beat on Youtube, "Lights Out" was recorded 3 seperate times at 3 different studios from July-Sep.
After the vocals were finished, it was sent out to Atlanta to get professionally mixed and then mastered in California.
After paying and getting the initial mix/master version 1.0, I found a website called "eMastered" that I now use to polish up and put the final touches on all of my masters'.
This song was recently played live on iHeartRadio after somebody submitted it and was heavily influenced by Jack Harlow's "What's Poppin'?" (style-wise).

"Off Track" was written in May of 2021 and was recorded just 2 weeks later after hearing a friend record a song using the same beat. I loved it so much that I coulnd't just sit there and let it go, I had to write something to it even though it was already in use.
It ended up gaining attention pretty quickly and surpassed 10K listeners on SoundCloud just within the first week alone.
